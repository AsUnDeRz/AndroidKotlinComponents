# AndroidKotlinComponents
A starter boilerplate project for Android, with Components Architecture implemented, written completely in Kotlin. 

## Basic Version 
Fetches Repositories from Github API 
- Rest API -> Retrofit 
- Database -> Room 
- Some Cool Helper Classes 
- And just a simple MainActivity that queries & shows the list of Repos

## BasicRx Version
- Basic version but utilizes Rx with Room & Retrofit instead of LiveData 

## Dagger Version
- Everything that Basic version includes but uses Dagger2 for Dependency Injection
